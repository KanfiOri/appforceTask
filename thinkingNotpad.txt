AppForce React architecture:
	App Component
		filter section ?? (bonus)
		Add Person that will pop up AddPerson component
		list of Prson component
		

	Person Component 
		Have delte button
		have edit Button => will open EditPerson Component

So for now the components are: 
App - main app
AddPerson
EditPerson

state =>
persons will be in app
filter??(bonus) will be in app

should be enough to start for now
